# CustomerBehaviorAnalysis

Customer behavior analysis involves examining patterns in how customers engage with a business, including their purchasing habits, preferences, and interactions with products or services. This analysis enables businesses to better understand customer motivations, allowing them to craft personalized marketing strategies, optimize offerings, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. By identifying trends such as frequent buyers or customers who may be at risk of disengaging, companies can target specific segments with tailored promotions or product recommendations.
